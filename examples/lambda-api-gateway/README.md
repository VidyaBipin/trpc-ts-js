# tRPC + AWS Api Gateway Lambda

For running locally, this project uses `@funnel-io/lalr` to run a mocked API gateway locally, which is invoked through `start-server`. You can read more about the tool [here](https://github.com/funnel-io/lalr).

## Run locally with @funnel-io/lalr

`$ yarn install`
`$ yarn start-server`
`$ yarn start-client`
