## A quick look at tRPC

For a quick video overview of tRPC's concepts, check out the videos below:

## Give tRPC a try

The fastest way to try tRPC is in an online REPL. Here are some options you can try out:

- [Minimal Example](https://stackblitz.com/github/trpc/trpc/tree/main/examples/minimal?file=server%2Findex.ts&file=client%2Findex.ts&view=editor) - this contains a minimal Node.js http server, and a client that calls a function on the server and logs the request to the console
- [Minimal Next.js Example](https://stackblitz.com/github/trpc/trpc/tree/main/examples/next-minimal-starter?file=src%2Fpages%2Fapi%2Ftrpc%2F[trpc].ts&file=src%2Fpages%2Findex.tsx) - this contains the smallest possible Next.js app that uses tRPC. It has a single endpoint that returns a string, and a page that calls that endpoint and displays the result.

If you prefer to get started in your local environment, you can use one of our [example apps](./example-apps.mdx) to get a starter project that you can experiment with locally.

## Use tRPC

"Using tRPC" means different things to different people. The goal of this page is to guide you to the right resources based on your goals.

### Becoming productive in an existing tRPC project

- Read the [concepts](./concepts.mdx) page.
- Become familiar with [routers](../server/routers.md), [procedures](../server/procedures.md), [context](../server/context.md), and [middleware](../server/middlewares.md).
- If you are using React, read about [useQuery](../reactjs/useQuery.md), [useMutation](../reactjs/useMutation.md) and [useContext](../reactjs/useContext.mdx).

### Creating a new project

Since tRPC can live inside of many different frameworks, you will first need to decide where you want to use it.

For the backend, there are [adapters](../server/adapters-intro.md) for a range of frameworks as well as vanilla Node.js. For the frontend, you can use our [React](../reactjs/introduction.mdx) or [Next.js](../nextjs/introduction.mdx) integrations, a [third-party integration](../community/awesome-trpc.mdx#frontend-frameworks) for a variety of other frameworks, or the [Vanilla Client](../client/setup.mdx), which works anywhere JavaScript runs.

After choosing your stack, you either scaffold your app using a [template](./example-apps.mdx), or start from scratch using the documentation for your chosen backend and frontend integration.

### Adding tRPC to an existing project

Adding tRPC to an existing project is not significantly different from starting a new project, so the same resources apply. The main challenge is that an existing project will contain more stuff than a new project, so it can feel difficult to know where the touching points are. Here are some tips:

- You don't need to port all of your existing backend logic to tRPC. A common migration strategy is to initally only use tRPC for new endpoints, and then gradually migrate existing endpoints to tRPC.
- If your project already uses Tanstack Query, make sure you don't end up with two `QueryClientProvider` components. This can happen especially in Next.js, where the `withTRPC` function already includes a QueryClientProvider of its own. If you are using `withTRPC` in your app, you should remove the `QueryClientProvider` from your `_app.tsx` file.
- If you're not sure where to start, check the documentation for your backend [adapter](../server/adapters-intro.md) and frontend implementation, as well as
- check docs your adapter and integration
- check sample projects
