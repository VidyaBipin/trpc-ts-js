"Getting started" means different things to different people. The goal of this page is to guide you to the right resources based on your goals.

## Becoming productive in an existing tRPC project.

- Read the [concepts](./concepts.mdx) page.
- The most important backend concepts are [routers](../server/routers.md), [procedures](../server/procedures.md), [context](../server/context.md), and [middleware](../server/middlewares.md).
- If you are using React, read about [useQuery](../reactjs/useQuery.md), [useMutation](../reactjs/useMutation.md) and [useContext](../reactjs/useContext.mdx).

## Creating a new project

Since tRPC can live inside of many different frameworks, you will first need to decide where you want to use it.

For the backend, there are [adapters](../server/adapters-intro.md) for a range of frameworks as well as vanilla Node.js. For the frontend, you can use our [React](../reactjs/introduction.mdx) or [Next.js](../nextjs/introduction.mdx) integrations, a [third-party integration](../community/awesome-trpc.mdx#frontend-frameworks) for a variety of other frameworks, or the [Vanilla Client](../client/setup.mdx), which works anywhere JavaScript runs.

After choosing your stack, there is one more decision: do you want to use a template to scaffold your application, or start from scratch? If you are using a template, TKTK. If you are starting from scratch, TKTK. You might still find the templates useful as a reference in addition to the documentation for your chosen stack.

## Adding tRPC to an existing project

Adding tRPC to an existing project is not significantly different from starting a new project, so the same resources apply. The main challenge is that an existing project will contain more stuff than a new project, so it can feel difficult to know where the touching points are. Here are some tips:

- You don't need to port all of your existing backend logic to tRPC. A common migration strategy is to initally only use tRPC for new endpoints, and then gradually migrate existing endpoints to tRPC.
- If you are in a codebase that already uses Tanstack Query, make sure you don't end up with two `QueryClientProvider` components. This can happen especially in Next.js, where the `withTRPC` function already includes a QueryClientProvider of its own. If you are using `withTRPC` in your app, you should remove the `QueryClientProvider` from your `_app.tsx` file.
