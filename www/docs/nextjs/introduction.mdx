### tRPC ❤️ Next.js

Next.js makes it easy to build a client and server together in one codebase. tRPC makes it easy to share types between them, ensuring typesafety for your application's data fetching.

Our Next.js integration combines our [React Query Integration](/docs/reactjs/introduction) with some Next.js specific APIs, to handle client-side and SSR needs.

:::tip
If you're using tRPC in a new project, consider using one of the example projects for reference: [tRPC Example Projects](example-apps)
