Import your `AppRouter` type into the client application. This type holds the shape of your entire API.

```ts
import type { AppRouter } from '../path/to/server/trpc';
```

:::tip
By using `import type` you ensure that the reference will be stripped at compile-time, meaning you don't inadvertently import server-side code into your client. For more information, [see the Typescript docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-8.html#type-only-imports-and-export).
