# OG Assets

Assets in this folder are used to generate the open graph images for blog posts. Replacing `bg.png` will replace the background image, replacing `font.ttf` will change the font.

Although the generated images are 1280x640 (as is desirable), the background image should be slightly taller (about 720px tall) because currently the library is clipping off part of the bottom of the background image for some reason.
