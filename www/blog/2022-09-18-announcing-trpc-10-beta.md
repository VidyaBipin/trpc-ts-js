Today we are excited to announce the beta release of tRPC 10.0! 

Going from version 9 to version 10 might not look like such a big deal but this is the biggest release yet of tRPC & the new version of tRPC is a complete overhaul of the API, front to back, and is packed with a bunch of new features, improved DX, and **a lot of** TypeScript performance improvements.


Things to bring up:

- Massively improved performance
- How to define a v10 router & procedure
- The `t` object
- Calling a procedure
- Multiple input parsers
- Magical API / Unparalleled DX
  - CMD+clicking and refactoring from the frontend
  - React-library rewritten
  - Sub-routers
- Rewritten links
- Decoupled from Node.js
- Client decoupled from HTTP-primitives
- *Still* zero code generation
- Reusable middlewares
- Reusable base procedures
- Easier to infer types
- Subscriptions rewritten
- Upgrade to react-query 4
- Incremental migration path - (maybe codemod soon)



Random phrases:

- Goodbye chainable routers, hello chainable procedures.
